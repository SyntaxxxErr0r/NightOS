Runtime levels are like "rights" in Windows.
Here are the different runtime levels :

0 Guest          Can access only to some files, when edit a file/directory save the changes in a Virtual File System
1 Simple user    Can access only to some files + his user directory
2 Admin          Can access to all the computer, excepted the system (-> can install/manage applications)
3 System 		 Can access to all the computer (and watch all user actions)
